# OldKekmetResources

## As of now, development on individual projects has been stopped in favour of one big mod, [GoodOldMSC](<https://akatsuki.nekoweb.org/project/goodoldmsc>).

This repository holds the resources required for compiling [OldKekmet](https://github.com/mldkyt/OldKekmet/).

## Building

1. Open this project inside of Unity 5.0.0f4
2. On the top, click on `Building` and then on `Build Asset Bundles`
3. Copy the files from the newly made `AssetBundles` folder under `Assets/Building` to the `Resources` folder inside `OldKekmet/OldKekmet` project.

These sounds were not made by me, they are taken from the 172 build of My Summer Car.
